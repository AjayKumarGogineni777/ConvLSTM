# ConvLSTM
Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM)

These are links to the training data and some saved model weights linked to my google drive.
I ran 6 epochs at once on google colab since I could not do more epochs since there was memory constraint.
The models folder contains the weights upto 30 epochs.
